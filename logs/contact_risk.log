2025-07-21 22:58:40,674 - INFO - Prompt constructed:  | You are an expert epidemiologist. Assess the COVID-19 risk from the following contact encounter: |  | - Contact Duration: 30 minutes | - Location Type: market | - Mask Used: No | - Social Distancing Followed: No | - Contact’s Symptoms: fever, sore throat | - Contact Travel History: Yes | - User’s Vaccination Status: partially vaccinated | - User’s Health Conditions: diabetes |  | Based on these details, provide a risk assessment on a scale of LOW, MODERATE, HIGH. Also explain the reasoning. | 
2025-07-21 22:58:59,402 - INFO - Ollama response:  Given the provided information, this contact encounter presents a **HIGH RISK** for COVID-19 transmission. Here's why: |  | 1. Contact Duration (30 minutes): Longer exposure durations increase the chances of infection, especially in high-risk settings like markets. |  | 2. Location Type (market): Markets are crowded places where social distancing is challenging and people often come into close contact with each other. This increases the likelihood of virus transmission. |  | 3. Mask Used (No): Not wearing a mask significantly reduces protection against respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. |  | 4. Social Distancing Followed (No): Lack of social distancing further enhances the risk of infection. |  | 5. Contact's Symptoms (fever, sore throat): These are common symptoms associated with COVID-19, indicating that the contact person might be infected. |  | 6. Contact Travel History (Yes): If the contact has traveled recently, there is a higher possibility they have been exposed to various pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. |  | 7. User's Vaccination Status (partially vaccinated): While being partially vaccinated offers some protection against severe disease and hospitalization, it does not eliminate the risk of infection or transmission. |  | 8. User's Health Conditions (diabetes): People with certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, are at increased risk for severe complications from COVID-19 if infected. |  | Given these factors, it is essential to take precautions, such as getting tested for COVID-19, self-isolating, and informing healthcare providers about this exposure, especially considering the user's health condition and partial vaccination status.
